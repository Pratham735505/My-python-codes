Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a life-changing force in the field of healthcare, revolutionizing the way, the medical professionals diagnose, treat, and manage patient care. AIâ€™s applications in healthcare are disease detection, personalized treatment of patients, recommendations, predictive analysis, and administrative streamlining. AI supportive technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision have enabled the development of innovative tools that enhance clinical decision making, improve patient outcomes, and optimize healthcare operations. While AI in healthcare holds immense promise, ethical and regulatory challenges must be addressed to ensure responsible implementation. In this research paper, I present the idea of a smart pillow that can sense your mood through sensors embedded in it and collects data. This will help it to detect the user's emotional state and potentially offer comfort or assistance accordingly by interacting with the user or providing some treatment like massage, interaction with the user. Based on the data analysis, the pillow's algorithms could infer the user's mood. For instance, increased heart rate, elevated skin temperature, and irregular movement might suggest anxiety or stress, while steady breathing and a relaxed heart rate could indicate calmness. This kind of pillow is useful in keeping the user calm and cool in this modern world which puts a lot of burden and stress on the people.

What is AI? AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the development of computer systems and software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.
AI systems are designed to simulate or mimic human intelligence to some degree, enabling them to perform tasks autonomously or with minimal human intervention.
Working of AI
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, works like a computer program that can learn and make decisions on its own, somewhat like how a human brain works.
Here's a simple explanation of how AI works:
1. Data Input: AI starts by taking in information or data. This data can be text, numbers, images, or any other kind of information.
2. Learning: AI uses this data to learn patterns and rules. It learns from examples and experiences, just like how we learn from our surroundings.
3. Processing: After learning, AI processes the data and looks for patterns, similarities, and differences. It might use math and logic to understand the information.
4. Decision-Making: Once it has processed the data, AI can make decisions or predictions based on what it has learned. For example, it can tell you if an email is spam or not, translate languages, or even play games.
5. Feedback Loop: AI can improve over time because it can learn from its own decisions and from new data. It can adjust its "thinking" based on the results of its previous actions.
6. Output: Finally, AI provides an output, which could be an answer, a recommendation, a task it completes, or any other action it was designed for.
